Other that I potentially should/could cover in this module:


1. Random variables and their properties
2. Mean, Variance, Standard Deviation in the context of sports
3. Probability distributions mainly discrete since easier to explain and no integrals required
4. Conditional/Joint Probability in the context of sports teammates
5. Joint distributions in the context of sports teammates
6. Expected value
