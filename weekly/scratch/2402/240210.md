Let S be equal to the sum of  N coins and assume you can make change from 0 to S. We need to show when we add the N+1th coin, we can make all change from 0 to (S + N+1th coin)

Base case. You have only 1 coin. S is equal to that 1 coin. Running sum is 0. If S is 1, the code returns 2. If S is > 1, then it's greater than running_sum+1 so it returns 1.

When you add a new coin, there are 3 scenarios, it's either equal to S, less than S, or greater than S.

Since we've assumed we can make all values from 0 to S, the only scenario where we can't make all values from S+1 to (S+N+1th coin) in if the N+1th coin is more than 1 bigger than S. It causes a gap in the incrementing.
