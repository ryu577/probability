# Basel sum converges
![[basel_sum.png]]

We need to show basel sum, $S_2$ converges. So, find an integral that is less than it for sure.

We can choose integral of $\frac{1}{x^2}$ from $0$ to $\infty$. But we run into a problem. If we integrate, this diverges as well and the proof doesn't work.

Instead, integrate from $1$ to $\infty$. This proves that $S_2-1$ converges. 

But that means $S_2$ must converge as well.
