1. Prove the identity: $\sum\limits_{s=0}^{\infty} {p-s \choose m}{q+s \choose q} = {p+q+1 \choose p-m}$
2. Read section on time reversible Markov chains from Ross.
3. Prove that $\frac{1}{(1-z)^k} = \sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty {{n+k-1}\choose {k-1}}z^n$
4. Trie from leetcode blind 75.
5. Describe one possible shape of the simplex when $n=4$ and $m=1$?

On the left hand side, it adds to p+q total people. And we're selecting m+q total people. The left most part can be rewritten as p-s choose p-s-m while the right side of the left hand side can be rewritten as q+s choose s.

right hand side can be written as p+q+1 choose q+m+1
