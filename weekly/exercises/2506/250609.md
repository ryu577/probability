- Study merge sort: section 3.2.1 from CLR book. What are its worst and average case time and space complexity?
- Interview qn I was asked at google: two binary search trees. Print all keys that are common. Without any extra space. Hint: think of merge sort. How does it work?
- Prove that in both, tree from inorder+preorder and inorder+postorder, partitioning the pre and post order arrays is not necessary and a moving index is enough.
- Exercise 21-a section 1.9 Blitzstein and Huang.

```python
class Solution:
    def buildTree(self, preorder: List[int], inorder: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        self.preorder_index = 0

        def helper(left, right):
            if left > right:
                return None

            root_val = preorder[self.preorder_index]
            self.preorder_index += 1
            root = TreeNode(root_val)

            index = inorder.index(root_val)

            root.left = helper(left, index - 1)
            root.right = helper(index + 1, right)

            return root

        return helper(0, len(inorder) - 1)
```
