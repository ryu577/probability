# Answer 4

A recurrent state is a state where the expected number of visits back to that state as n approaches infinity is infinite. In other words, that state will never stop being visited. A transient state is a state where as n approaches infinity, the expected number of visits to that state is finite. In other words, eventually, the state will not be visited anymore after a certain number of steps. An irreducible markov chain is a markov chain in which every state can be reached from every other state.
