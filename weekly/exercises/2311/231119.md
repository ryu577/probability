1) P1: Derive Sterling's approximation from central limit theorem (see Ross).
2) P0: Use the integral sandwich trick to prove that the Reimann Zeta converges after $1$ but not at or before $1$.
3)  P0: Prove end to end that a symmetric, 2-d random walk modeled as a Markov chain is recurrent while a 3-d random walk is transient.
4) P0: Connect all the pieces of BFS proof together and write it in your own words.
5) P1: Watch Mathologer's video on Euler's proof of Basel problem. Write down the key elements in your own words.
6) P2: Prove that $e$ is an irrational number (feel free to look up proofs online, including Mathologer's video).
