4. Lemma 22.1 - This one is easy. It's just saying that if there's an edge from U to V, then the shortest past from S to V can't be more than 1 greater than the shortest path from S to U. This is because once we take the shortest path from S to U, the quickest way to get to V has to be to take the edge from U to V - any other way wouldn't be the shortest path.

	Lemma 22.2 - This one is saying that after running BFS algorithm in it's entirety, the d attribute of every node has to be greater than or equal to the shortest path from the source to that node. They use induction to explain why. 
		1. The base case is when there's just one node in the queue, the source node. S.d is by default 0, and that obviously is the shortest path from S to itself, and earlier in the code we initialize all the nodes d attributes to be infinity, which has to be greater than or equal to whatever the shortest path is.
		2. Now we consider what happens when a white (undiscovered) vertex v is seen in the loop after popping off u from the queue. The inductive hypothesis is that u.d >= s(s,u). In the code, we set v's d attribute to be equal to u.d + 1. If u.d >=s(s,u), then obviously adding 1 to both sides preserves this property, and u.d+1 >= s(s,u)+1. But in lemma 22.1, we just proved that the s(s,v) has to be less than or equal to s(s,u)+1. So if v.d is greater than or equal to s(s,u)+1, it has to be also greater than s(s,v). And so we have proven that v.d >= s(s,v)
		
	Lemma 22.3 - This one is saying that the last value of the queue cannot have a d attribute  more than 1 greater than the first value of the queue's d attribute, and any value of the queue must have a d value greater or equal to the d values of the elements to the right of it.
	 PART ONE
		1. To prove this we start with the fact that when we enqueue a new node to the queue which we'll call Vr+1, from the code itself, it's d attribute is equal to U.d+1, where U is the node that was popped off from the queue and who's children are being iterated over. 
		2. One of our inductive hypotheses claims that U.d <= V1.d, so we have this fact too.
		3. If we just add 1 to both sides of step 2, the inequality remains the same, U.d+1 <= V1.d+1
		4. But in step 1 we said U.d+1 = Vr+1.d, so if we just substitute in Vr+1.d we prove one of the inductive hypotheses that Vr+1.d <= V1.d+1, where V1 is the new head node after U has been popped off
     PART TWO
      1.  To prove this part we again start from the fact that when we enqueue a new node to the queue which we'll call Vr+1, from the code itself, it's d attribute is equal to U.d+1, where U is the node that was popped off from the queue and who's children are being iterated over. 
      2. The inductive hypothesis says that Vr.d can't be more than 1 greater than u.d. But we already know that u.d+1 is equal to Vr+1.d. So Vr.d has to be less than or equal to Vr+1.d, which is the node directly to the right of it.

 Corollary 22.4
		1. If Vi and Vj are enqueued during the execution of BFS, and Vi is enqueued before Vj, then vi.d <= vj.d at the time Vj is enqueued, regardless of whether vi is still in the queue or not. This is because a vertex's d attribute is only modified once no matter what, since we have the seen array to make sure we don't count vertices twice. Combining this with Lemme 22.3 we can reach this corollary.


Theorem 22.5
		1. This is the main reason for all the lemmas. We're trying to show that after BFS is done running, every vertex's d attribute is equal to the shortest path from the source node to that vertex, which we write as S(s,v). 
		2. To prove this we use contradiction. For this theorem to be false, there has to be at least 1 vertex with a d attribute that is not equal to it's shortest path. 
		3. Let's call v the vertex with the minimum S(s,v) that receives an incorrect d attribute. Meaning if S(s,v) is 3, then there is no other vertex with a shortest path < 3 that has an incorrect d attribute.
		4. Using lemme 22.3, we already proved that v.d >= S(s,v) for every v, but by the way we defined v, obviously v.d!=S(s,v), so we have v.d > S(s,v).
		5. Now if we pick a vertex u that comes immediately before v on the shortest path from s to v, so that S(s,v) = S(s,u)+1, then we have the resulting expression: v.d > S(s,v) = S(s,u)+1 = u.d+1
		6. We need to show that the above expression is a contradiction in the 3 different scenarios of BFS vetex discovery - either the vertex is white (unseen), gray (seen but not iterated over), or black (seen and iterated over children)
			1. if the discovered vertex is white, then we set v.d = u.d+1. This contradicts the expresson in bullet 5
			2. If the discovered vertex is black, then it was already removed from queue and iterated over, which would mean that v.d <= u.d, which contracts v.d <= u.d+1 in the expression from bullet 5
			3. If the discovered vertex is gray, then it means it's d attribute was already incremented by 1 because it was the child of a vertex which we'll call w. But by corollary 22.4 again, w.d has to be <= u.d, so v.d = w.d+1 <= u.d+1, which contradicts v.d > u.d+1 from the expression in bullet 5



5. Basel Problem Mathologer Key Points/Questions/Notes
	1. Why can't we know conclusively if reimann zeta function evaluates to anything for odd numbers > 1
		1. rohit: We know the number upto many decimal places. Just not if its anything nice like $\pi^2/6$.
	2. First shows that 1/s^2 infinite sum is bound above by 2, because he takes a bigger infinite sum that in the limit evaluates to 2.
	3. Taylor series expansion of sine is straightforward
	4. Confused where he plugs in the pis instead of 0 for the taylor series. why?
		1. rohit: Please include timestamps with your questions. I'm not sure which part you're referring to. In general, he can plug in what he wants. He's Euler so of course he is going to think of doing things that might not be obvious why :)
	5. He then starts with a cubic polynomial that has roots x= pi and x = -pi, and fits it to the sine curve partial sum
	6. Why is the constant required to make the cubic polynomial fit equal to 1/pi^2? He says in the video it's pretty obvious. 
		1. rohit: Just plug in something trivial like x=0 into the cubic polynomial.
	7. How to check that cubic has slope 1 at 0? Take derivative? 11:35 in video
		1. rohit: Yes, take the derivative of the cubic and plug in x=0.
