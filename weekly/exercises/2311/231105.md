1) P2: How limits are defined and derivation of L'hospitals rule (3B1B video):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfF40MiS7zA
2) P2: Law of large numbers and central limit theorem - what is the difference between them? Why do we need law of large numbers when we have central limit theorem?

Summary of session:
- Infinite geometric series: $S = 1+r+r^2+r^3+ ...$  
- Arithico geometric series: $S = r+2 r^2+3 r^3+ ...$
- Using the trick on the Reimann Zeta function to get connection to primes: $\zeta(z)=\frac{1}{1^z}+\frac{1}{2^z}+\frac{1}{3^z}+... = \frac{1}{(1-\frac{1}{2^z})(1-\frac{1}{3^z})(1-\frac{1}{5^z})...}$
- Proving that the harmonic series diverges by cancelling out multiples of 2.
	- Can also prove it by canceling out multiples of 3. See below image.
- Proving there are infinite primes.
	- With $\zeta(1)$.
	- With $\zeta(2)$: rational, irrational and transcendental numbers.
