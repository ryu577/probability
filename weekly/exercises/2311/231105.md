2) P2: Law of large numbers and central limit theorem - what is the difference between them? Why do we need law of large numbers when we have central limit theorem?

Summary of session:
- Infinite geometric series: $S = 1+r+r^2+r^3+ ...$
- Arithico geometric series: $S = r+2 r^2+3 r^3+ ...$
- Using the trick on the Reimann Zeta function to get connection to primes: $\zeta(z)=\frac{1}{1^z}+\frac{1}{2^z}+\frac{1}{3^z}+... = \frac{1}{(1-\frac{1}{2^z})(1-\frac{1}{3^z})(1-\frac{1}{5^z})...}$
- Proving that the harmonic series diverges by cancelling out multiples of 2.
	- Can also prove it by canceling out multiples of 3. See below image.
- Proving there are infinite primes.
	- With $\zeta(1)$.
	- With $\zeta(2)$: rational, irrational and transcendental numbers.

A common trick for infinite sums is to multiply the sum by some number, get another equation and then subtract the two equations. The infinite geometric series can be solved in this way.

To demonstrate this as a more general trick, see how the exact same steps can be used to solve the arithico-geometric series.

Leonhard Euler, the GOAT of mathematics used repeated applications of this same simple trick infinite times to establish the connections between the Zeta function and the primes.
