1) P0: Watch Mathologer's video on Euler's proof of Basel problem. Write down the key elements in your own words.
2) P1: Prove that $e$ is an irrational number (feel free to look up proofs online, including Mathologer's video).
3) P0: Exercise 22.2-7 and 22.2-5 of BFS chapter (algorithms).
4) P0: For a 3-d random walk, write the expected number of times the walk will return to zero if run indefinitely as a triple summation over $n$, $i$ and $j$. Pull out the terms out of the summations as much as you can and try to complete binomial coefficients.
5) P2: code up the multinomial term of a 3-d random walk in a way that is numerically stable.
6) P1: Read section 4.4 of Ross up until example 4.24.




1. Here are the key elements of Euler's proof of the Basel problem.
	1. First he sets an upper bound of what the infinite sum 1/n^2 can possibly be equal to by slightly modifying it and working out another infinite sum. This second infinite sum in the limit is shown to be equal to 2, so we know right away that the basel problem infinite sum cannot be more than 2.
	2. Second, he uses two different ways of writing the Sine function to prove the basel problem. First, he writes out the Taylor series for sine and second he writes out sine as product of infinite polynomials.
	3. Then he compares the coefficients of the cubic terms for both the Taylor series and infinite polynomials, and uses algebra to produce the famous basel problem solution

3. 22.2-5: The d attribute of a node V is updated once, and is 1 greater than that of it's parent node which we can call U. At the time that V is incremented, U has already been popped off the queue, and no other changes happen to U after that - it's d attribute was modified before it ever entered the queue and remains that same value. Therefore it doesn't matter whether the order in which we examine U's children is 'A,B,C,D' or 'B,A,C,D' or any other permutation, because since U's d value is fixed, all of U's children's D values will be equal to U.d +1, regardless of their order in the adjacency list.
	22.2-7:
	~~~Python
	    def isBipartite(gaph):

        from collections import deque
        queue = deque()
        queue.append((0,0))

        colors = [-1 for val in range(len(graph))]

        for val in graph:
            if len(val)==0:
                return False

  

        while queue:
            node,color = queue.popleft()
            colors[node]=color

  

            for val in graph[node]:
                if colors[val]==-1:
                    if color==0:
                        queue.append((val,1))
                    else:
                        queue.append((val,0))
                else:
                    if colors[val]==color:
                        return False

        return True

4. Non numerically stable answer:
	~~~Python 
	import math
import numpy as np

def return_value(i,j,n):
	if i+j>n:
		return 'Cannot compute'

	coefficient = math.factorial(2*n)/((math.factorial(i)**2)*(math.factorial(j)**2)*(math.factorial(n-i-j))**2)
	return coefficient*((1/6)**(2*n))



n = 7

total = 0
for i in range(n+1):
	for j in range(n-i+1):
		total+=return_value(i,j,n)

print("Total using combinatorics: ",total)





def simulation(n):
	choices = [(0,0,1),(0,0,-1),(0,1,0),(0,-1,0),(1,0,0),(-1,0,0)]
	start = [0,0,0]

	double_n = 2*n
	while double_n > 0:
		choice_index = np.random.choice(6,p=[1/6,1/6,1/6,1/6,1/6,1/6])
		choice = choices[choice_index]

		start[0]+=choice[0]
		start[1]+=choice[1]
		start[2]+=choice[2]

		double_n-=1


	if start[0]==0 and start[1]==0 and start[2]==0:
		return 1
	return 0


returned = 0
not_returned = 0
for val in range(10000):
	result = simulation(n)
	if result==1:
		returned+=1
	else:
		not_returned+=1

print('Total using simulation: ',returned/(returned+not_returned))

6. Definitions:
	1. Periodic vs Aperiodic - period is just greatest common denominator of N where state  i can return back to itself. So if state i in 4 steps can return back to itself in 2 steps and 4 steps, the period is 2. Aperiodic happens if there's a self loop. You can go back to the state you started in 1 step. 
	2. Recurrence and Positive Recurrence -
