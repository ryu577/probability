1) P0: Watch Mathologer's video on Euler's proof of Basel problem. Write down the key elements in your own words.
2) P1: Prove that $e$ is an irrational number (feel free to look up proofs online, including Mathologer's video).
3) P0: Exercise 22.2-7 and 22.2-5 of BFS chapter (algorithms).
4) P0: For a 3-d random walk, write the expected number of times the walk will return to zero if run indefinitely as a triple summation over $n$, $i$ and $j$. Pull out the terms out of the summations as much as you can and try to complete binomial coefficients.
5) P2: code up the multinomial term of a 3-d random walk in a way that is numerically stable.
6) P1: Read section 4.4 of Ross up until example 4.24.
