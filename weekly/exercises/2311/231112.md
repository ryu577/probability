1) P0: Use the integral sandwich trick to prove that the Reimann Zeta converges after $1$ but not at or before $1$.
3) P0: Prove end to end that a symmetric, 2-d random walk modeled as a Markov chain is recurrent.
4) P0: What is the probability that a 1-d random walk which goes forward with probability $p$ and back with probability $1-p$ will ever get back to the origin? Derive it in your own words below.
	1) Think of it as an infinite dynamic programming array over all integers. We want dp_0.
	2) Create a recurrence at 0. 
		1) Use law of large numbers to show you don't have to worry about one side.
	3) But 0 is special since you're done if you go back. Create recurrence at 1 as well and expand further.
5) P1: From the CLR book, read the section on breadth first search (elementary graph algorithms).
