Questions from Orthonormal Linear Algebra Chapter

1. Why does the cosine version of dot product match up to the multiply then add version of the dot product. Just curious where that even comes from
2. If we're at v3, we subtract off the projections onto u1 AND u2? that's interesting. I'll have to draw it out. It makes sense when we're subtracting off 1 projection but a bit confusing when talking about subtracting off multiple projections
3. Why is the projection formula the dot product of 2 vectors divided by the vector dotted with itself?
4. I dont get exactly why with an orthonormal matrix, A dot A transpose is the identity matrix
5. The whole proof of why A transpose is orthonormal i don't get why it's so complicated.
