2. 15 players on an NBA team. Say we have 7 on roids, 8 not on roids. We want to compare the rate at which both these groups miss games, and see if there's enough of a difference to show that steroids more than likely have an effect on injuries..

	Null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the rate at which the two groups miss games - aka roids have no effect on injuries 

	 Alternate hypothesis is that players who take roids on average miss games more frequently than players who don't take roids.

	 test statistic is
