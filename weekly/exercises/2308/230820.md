1. P0: Beta regression: Come up with some decent Betas and close the loop on the decision process with them.

- For each bet in the testing sample, come up with the predicted a1 and a2. This gives you the Beta distribution for each testing sample. This is the distribution of the probability that the bet will "win".

- Then, there is the implied probability from the book for that bet. You can bet against or bet for. Calculate the probability that your Beta distribution is greater than the implied probability. Which is survival function at the implied probability. This is the p-score of betting for. Similarly, the CDF of the Beta distribution at the implied probability is the p-score of betting against.

- Rank all the actions (possible bets for or against) by p-scores descending. See if the top ones would make good bets.

2. P0: solve the limit: $\lim_{n \to \infty} ((a^{1/n}+b^{1/n})/2)^n$.

3. P1: Dynamic programming: Write code for min coin change 1 so that we get the actual coins to use, not just min number.

4. P1: Markov chains: Read section 4.2 on Chapman Kolmogrov equations. Ask some questions about the parts you're stuck at.

5. P2: You generate 10 uniform random numbers. Then take the difference of the seventh largest and third largest. What is the distribution of this number? Feel free to use a computer (Scale interview question).
