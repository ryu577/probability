1) P0: Beta regression model - experiment with different strategies for creating the training data. Then get the p-scores for each action and see which strategy makes good bets rise to the top (in terms of p-scores). #prob 
2) P1: Find the derivative of the function, $cos(x)$ in two ways: #math/algebra 
	1) Write it in Taylor series and take the derivative.
	2) Using first principal, with limits.
3) P0: Prove that $y \log(x) = log(x^y)$. Write it out in Obsidian.
4) P0: Write the Taylor series expansion of: $x^{1/n}$ and also of $\log(x)$. Then use them to prove: $x^{1/n} = 1+log(x)/n + O(1/n^2)$ #math/algebra 
5) P0: Complete section on Chapman Kolmogrov equations (Ross book). #prob 
6) P0: Using induction, prove that in a markov chain with transition matrix, $P$, given that we start in state $i$, the probability we'll be in state $j$ after $n$ steps is $P^n_{i,j}$
7) P1: Get the actual coins in the min coins needed for change problem in O(n) time. #cs/dynprogr 
	1) Hint: Maintain an array similar to dp array (same size) where you store the largest coin used to make the amount.
8) P2: You generate 10 uniform random numbers. Then take the difference of the seventh largest and third largest. What is the distribution of this number? Use gradient descent to get the parameters.

Solutions here.

Here is the code for getting the min number of coins as a reminder.
