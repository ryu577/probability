1) P0: Beta regression model - experiment with different strategies for creating the training data. Then get the p-scores for each action and see which strategy makes good bets rise to the top (in terms of p-scores).
2) P1: Find the derivative of the function, $cos(x)$ in two ways:
	1) Write it in Taylor series and take the derivative.
	2) Using first principal as the limit.
