- Prove that integers and rational numbers are the same size. See hannah fry infinity is weird for reference.
- Binary tree from inorder and postorder. See code for inorder pre-order and think of how it'll need to be modified.
   - Hint: post order prints the root last. Take this idea and recurse.
- Example 4.35 from Ross: understand urn model.
- Interview qn I was asked at google: two binary search trees. Print all keys that are common. Without any extra space.
   - Hint: think of merge sort. How does it work?
