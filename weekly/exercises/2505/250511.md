- Prove that in both, tree from inorder+preorder and inorder+postorder, partitioning the pre and post order arrays is not necessary and a moving index is enough.
- Pseudo code for binary tree from post order and pre-order. High level approach with recursion is enough.
- Example 4.35 from Ross: understand urn model.
- Interview qn I was asked at google: two binary search trees. Print all keys that are common. Without any extra space.
Hint: think of merge sort. How does it work?
