6) P0: Read section on matrix chain multiplication from CLR book.
7) P0: Generate all permutations of an array. (https://www.baeldung.com/cs/array-generate-all-permutations). There was an error in the statement I made. What was the error? What are the advantages vis-a-vis your old solution?
8) P2: For the database, include tables for a referral system. Take your actual db and create a function that returns the users table we created.
