# Algebra exercises
1. There is a fourth degree polynomial, $f$. This polynomial is always greater than $y=x$. We further know that $f(2)=2$ and $f(4)=4$. Find any polynomial, $f$ that satisfies all of these conditions.

1. P1: Read [this blog](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/a-birds-eye-view-of-linear-algebra-systems-of-equations-linear-regression-and-neural-networks-fe5b88a57f66), section II-B. Explain how we can use weights for linear regression. Also read section III neural networks
2. P0: For a random variable $X_1$, what is $Cov(X_1,X_1)$? And what is the coefficient of correlation?
3. P0: Steady state probabilities of a Markov chain that is not irreducible. Fix the bug in your code.
4. P1: Review the Beta regression model we were working on and how far did we get?
5. P0: When we solve the steady state equations of a Markov chain, we get $n+1$ equations but only $n$ variables (the steady state probabilities). Prove that this system will always have a unique solution.
6. P0: In Q2 of [[231231]], how much money a month was AI-betting edge making?
