- Proof of $n(n+1)/2$ using Gauss method. How will you extend this to general sum of arithmetic series?
- Solve recurrence for string partition problem using $S(n)$ approach.
- Complexity analysis for leetcode array jump problem. Time and space.
- Gambler's ruin problem with $n=7$ and $i=3$. Ross has an example on this using transient state times. Solve with that.
- Derive gambler's ruin for $p=q$ case. Then extend it to solving the interview problem (Tennis).
- Prove the white path theorem from CLRS.


1. For Gauss' method with even numbers it's straight forward - there are n/2 pairs of numbers that all sum to n+1 if you take the first and last elements of the list of numbers and keep pairing them. 
	For odd numbers, there are n-1/2 pairs that sum to n+1. then the middle number always sums to (n+1)/2. so you factor out n+1/2 and the remaining term is (n-1)+1 which becomes n so the formula works out.
