1) P0: Read the following blog: https://medium.com/intuitionmath/p-np-would-mean-were-a-bunch-of-dumb-apes-20c6e50f0ba3 (if you don't have medium membership, use [this](https://medium.com/intuitionmath/p-np-would-mean-were-a-bunch-of-dumb-apes-20c6e50f0ba3?sk=a2cf791d5a2b51de922c2b237a7906b8)). Very important to do this today.
2) P0: Write the Taylor series expansion of: $x^{1/n}$ and also of $\log(x)$. Then use them to prove: $x^{1/n} = 1+log(x)/n + O(1/n^2)$ #math/algebra . Write it out like you would be submitting it for credit at a university.
3) P0: Write efficient code for longest increasing sub-sequence where you actually get the subsequence, not just its length.
4)  P1: Exercise 15-12 of "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen. 
	1) Solve the problem left to right.
	2) Come up with the computational complexity on inputs.
5) P0: Ross book: Read everything including example 4.18.
6) P2 (Google interview question): You have two binary search trees. They could have duplicates. You need to print the nodes that are common (including repetition). Come up with an algorithm that works well when one of the trees is large and the other is small. Come up with a space and time efficient algorithm when both trees are large.
7) P2: Trignometry and limits: Explain [this](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/75130/how-to-prove-that-lim-limits-x-to0-frac-sin-xx-1) to me like I'm five.
