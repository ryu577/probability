2) P0: Explain the following terms:
	1) Recurrent states, transient states, irreducible Markov chain.
3) P0: Prove end to end that a symmetric, 2-d random walk modeled as a Markov chain is recurrent.
4) P0: What is the probability that a 1-d random walk which goes forward with probability $p$ and back with probability $1-p$ will ever get back to the origin? Derive it in your own words below.
5) P1: From the CLR book, read the section on breadth first search (elementary graph algorithms).
6) P2: Have a setup where you can share your screen and write by next week. Either figure out how to do it on the Boox or purchase a cheap Android tablet with stylus.
