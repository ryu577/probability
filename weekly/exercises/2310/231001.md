1) P0: Write the Taylor series expansion of: $x^{1/n}$ and also of $\log(x)$. Then use them to prove: $x^{1/n} = 1+log(x)/n + O(1/n^2)$ #math/algebra 
2) P0: Write efficient code for longest increasing sub-sequence where you actually get the subsequence, not just its length.
3)  P1: Exercise 15-12 of "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen. Come up with an approach for solving it. Describe the matrix based on my hint and describe a procedure for filling it up.
4) P0: Ross book: Read upto example 4.18.
5) P2 (Google interview question): You have two binary search trees. They could have duplicates. You need to print the nodes that are common (including repetition). Come up with an algorithm that works well when one of the trees is large and the other is small. Come up with a space and time efficient algorithm when both trees are large.
6) P2: Read the following blog: https://medium.com/intuitionmath/p-np-would-mean-were-a-bunch-of-dumb-apes-20c6e50f0ba3 (if you don't have medium membership, use [this](https://medium.com/intuitionmath/p-np-would-mean-were-a-bunch-of-dumb-apes-20c6e50f0ba3?sk=a2cf791d5a2b51de922c2b237a7906b8))
7) P2: Trignometry and limits: Explain [this](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/75130/how-to-prove-that-lim-limits-x-to0-frac-sin-xx-1) to me like I'm five.
