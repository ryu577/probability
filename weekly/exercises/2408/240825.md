1. exercise 11 of Shiffrin with complex nose.
1.1 prove that $e^{i \theta} = \cos(\theta)+ i \sin(\theta)$. Given i.i=-1 and Taylor's series. This is called the most beautiful formula in Mathematics and is courtesey Euler.
1.2 Assume first vertex is the number 1 in the complex plane.
1.3 get complex nos for all vertices of polygon.
1.4 use geometric series to show that the complex nos sum to 1.
