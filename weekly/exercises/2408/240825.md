1. Exercise 11 of Shiffrin with complex nose.
	1. 1.1 prove that $e^{i \theta} = \cos(\theta)+ i \sin(\theta)$. Given $i$. $i=-1$ and Taylor's series. This is called the most beautiful formula in Mathematics and is courtesy Euler.
	2. 1.2 Assume first vertex is the number 1 in the complex plane.
	3. 1.3 get complex nos for all vertices of polygon.
	4. 1.4 use geometric series to show that the complex nos sum to 1.
2. Exercise 20 of ch4 in Ross 10th Ed.
	1. 2.1 Review exact definition of steady state from the book.
	2. 2.2 review animation 1 of chapter 3 of my linear algebra book "why is Matrix multiplication like that".
	3. 2.3 Combine to prove result.
1. Watch RNNs are cursed video.
2. Read Proof that steps for going to n is $O(n^2)$.
3. Write out proof of exercise 15 ch4 in Ross 10th Ed.
4. Argue that the null space of a rotation matrix with non trivial rotation must have dimensionality of $0$.
