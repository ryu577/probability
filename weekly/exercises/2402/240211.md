1) P0: DFS with stack: https://walkccc.me/CLRS/Chap22/22.3/
2) P0: You suspect Balmer is going to pick according to some probability distribution: $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_{100}$. How do you come up with optimal strategy? Read CLR chapter on dynamic programming and identify the section.
3) P0: Create your resume and add it to Obsidian.
4) P0: Prove that the solution for min change can't make problem works with induction.
5) P0: Start making progress on adding friction to the unsubscribe page. 
	1) Future: Your website should have a stage version you can test locally.
	2) This week: On the front end, add a pop-up when the button is pressed with a message and another button that actually unsubscribe.
	3) Future: There should be 2 buttons on the pop-up. One of them should unsubscribe immediately and the other should reduce the rate to 25 dollars a month forever.
	4) Future: Add a timer to the unsubscribe button where after 3 months, the rate reverts.
6) P1: Read example 4.25 of Ross.

7) P1: Find the bug in your computation of 4.24. Here is mine:

# Thoughts about AI betting edge
For your website to be a transient Markov chain (and not recurrent), we need to take it out of steady state. The rate at which subscribers comes in is $\lambda$ subs a month and the rate at which they un-subscribe is $\mu$. We want to make $\lambda$ increase and $\mu$ decrease.
1) Making $\mu$ decrease.
	1) Of course, making the model and picks better will make $\mu$ go down. But that is a law of diminishing returns.
	2) Add some friction to the un-subscribe page. Show them a pop-up reminding them that they will lose access to the course as well. Also, offer them a discounted rate of 25 bucks a month for 3 months. After that, they'll revert to the regular rate.
	3) Complete the course and make sure it is clearly visible on the front page for subscribers. Also market it during the signup process.
2) Making $\lambda$ increase.
	1) Increase the menu of offerings similar to Patreon. 50 dollars a month is a lot. Add options for 25 dollars a month, 10 dollars a month.
	2) Write one LinkedIn and Twitter post every week talking about sports betting. At the bottom of the posts, link to AI betting edge.
