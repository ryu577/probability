1. P0: Prove that to get the the 2 by 2 Markov chain with only good and bad states, we have to divide by $\pi_1+\pi_2$. 
2. P0: Example 4.24 of Ross book: demonstrate that our approach of combining states is equivalent to his approach with a lot of algebra.
3. P0: The non-irreducible Markov chain you were working on (Ross book); explain what happens to it after a long time using Eigen value approach we discussed.
4. P0: Prove that if you try to do parenthesis theorem for BFS, it won't work. The counter-example you provided last time, code it up. When vertex is marked grey, parenthesis open. When black, its closed.
5. P1: Implement DFS without recursion (exercise 22.3-7, CLR book).
6. P1: Exercise 22.3-9 and 22.3-10 of CLR book
