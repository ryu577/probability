 The stationary distribution part of 4.25 is an interesting concept. Rather than solving using linear algebra as we've done in the past, he solves this through just logic of what it means for a process to be in steady state. 
	1. First, we need an infinite dimensional, discrete distribution to represent the probability of a certain number of people being in the hotel, because people are countable discrete objects but there can technically be infinite people in the hotel. He chooses Poisson distribution for this purpose. He says that the initial distribution of people in the hotel, rather than being fixed as we've done in the past, is a random variable that follows a Poisson distribution with mean alpha. We can view this as an infinite dimensional vector, where each entry is the probability of that number of people being in the hotel.
	2. He then says defines N as another Poisson distribution which is the number of people who stay in the hotel from the previous timestep. Since each of the people staying in the hotel have a probability of q of staying the next day (defined in book), he defines the number of people who stay the next day to be a Poisson distribution with lambda = alpha * q. And that makes intuitive sense because we don't know exactly how many people were in the hotel the previous day, but we know it's a Poisson distribution with mean = alpha. So we can say that in expectation, q * alpha of these people stay the next day. 
	3. Next, he defines a 3rd Poisson random variable with mean lambda which is equal to the number of new people that come to stay at the hotel on any given day. So we have 3 poisson variables at this point. alpha which is initial, lambda which is new people next day, and alpha * q which is number of people who stay from previous day
	4. Now by definition of steady state, where the probabilities of being in any state don't change after a transition, if we start with alpha, and add lambda new people and alpha * q people stay, then when the process is in steady state, alpha has to equal lambda + alpha * q.
	5. If we solve the above for alpha, we get alpha = lambda / p. (since p is 1-q). And that means that when we have lambda/p people in the hotel, the process is in steady state.
