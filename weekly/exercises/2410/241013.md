- P0: Prove that finding a grey vertex in a directed graph implies a cycle. Use CLR book lemmas and results for this.
- Prove from the definitions of covariance and variance that: $Var(X+Y) = Var(X)+Var(Y)+2Cov(X,Y)$
- Complete the phoenix gamblers ruin problem from Ross.
- A gambler has $3$ dollars. He tosses a coin with a probability $0.4$ of winning each round (he gets one dollar if he wins and loses one dollar if he loses). If he gets to 7 dollars, he stops playing. What is the expected amount of time the gambler has $5$ dollars?
- Do the clone graph problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/description/.


P0:

Part 1 of proof:
Theorem 20.9 (White-path theorem)
In a depth first forest of a directed or undirected graph, vertex U is a descendant of V if and only if at the time V is discovered, there is a path from V to U consisting of only white vertices.

Part 2 of proof:
A directed graph G is acyclic if and only if a DFS of G yields no back edges.

So we need to show that there is a back edge in a cyclic graph.

Part 3 of proof:
By the white path theorem, when V is discovered, there is a path of white vertices to U. Then when DFS comes to U, it makes it a descendant of V. When DFS comes to the edge U->V, V is already an ancestor of U, making it a back edge, but also clearly showing a cycle since first V is an ancestor of U and then U points back to V.
