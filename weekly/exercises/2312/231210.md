1) P0: Read section 4.4 of Ross up until example 4.24. Make notes detailing your understanding of the different kinds of Markov chains.
2) P1: Get the sample mean of 10,000 Cauchy random numbers. Repeat this 20 times and plot the histogram. Do the same for 10,000 random variables from the exponential distribution.
3) P0: Do the same thing Euler did to prove the Basel problem, but for cosine instead of sin. Convert it to Basel sum.
4) P1: Does the infinite series below converge or diverge? Why? If it converges, what does it converge to?
$$S = \frac{1}{1 \times 2} + \frac{1}{2\times 3}+\frac{1}{3\times 4}+\dots$$
5) P1: Create a Obsidian folder "course_content". Add the topics along with basic content there.
6) P2: The combinatorial term we encountered for the case of the 3-d random walk. Implement it in a numerically sound way in Python.
7) P1: Write CLR versions of DFS and BFS in Python. Don't skimp on any of the properties.
8) P2: Subscribers come to your website and become paid members at rate $\lambda$ and leave (unsubscribe) at rate $\mu$. If this process were a continuous time Markov chain, what would the states be and what would they represent? How many states would such a Markov chain have?
9) P3: Read the blog: https://medium.com/@rohitpandey576/cauchy-distribution-has-no-mean-from-huygens-principle-optics-38a588eb2e7b. Make notes about it and ask questions.
