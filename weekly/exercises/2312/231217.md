Algebra exercises:
1. Order from greatest to least  
    a) $25^{100}$ 
    b) $2^{300}$  
    c) $3^{400}$  
    d) $4^{200}$  
    e) $2^{600}$
Hint: Take $\log_2$ of all numbers. Then all you need from there is the fact that $2^.5 = 1.414$
2. Find at least one rational root of the equation: $x^3 - 7x + 6$
Hint: What does rational number mean? Also, take the 6 term to the other side.
3. If $16^x + 16^{x - 1} = 10$, find $2^{2x}$
# Regular stuff
1. P0: Write in your own words end to end from cosine expansion to the Basel sum.
2. P1: Does the infinite series below converge or diverge? Why? If it converges, what does it converge to?
$$S = \frac{1}{1 \times 2 \times 3} + \frac{1}{2\times 3 \times 4}+\frac{1}{3\times 4 \times 5}+\dots$$
3) P2: The combinatorial term we encountered for the case of the 3-d random walk. Implement it in a numerically sound way in Python.
4) P0: People subscribe to and cancel to AI betting edge at discrete time intervals (beginning of every day). If there are $i$ subscribers already, the probability of a new subscriber is $\frac{.5^i}{1+.5^i}$. Each subscriber starts tossing a coin with probability $.1$ of heads every day after they subscribe. The day they get a heads is the day they unsubscribe. Once we get to 20 subscribers, we stop accepting new ones. You charge 50 dollars a month. In the steady state, how much income will you be making a month? You will need a computer for this one.
5) P1: Write CLR versions of DFS and BFS in Python. Don't skimp on any of the properties.
