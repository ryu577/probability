Algebra exercises:
1. Order from greatest to least  
    a) $25^{100}$ 
    b) $2^{300}$  
    c) $3^{400}$  
    d) $4^{200}$  
    e) $2^{600}$
Hint: Take $\log_2$ of all numbers. Then all you need from there is the fact that $2^.5 = 1.414$
2. Find at least one rational root of the equation: $x^3 - 7x + 6$
Hint: What does rational number mean? Also, take the 6 term to the other side.
		Use the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_root_theorem to find all other roots (we know they are all rational).
1. If $16^x + 16^{x - 1} = 10$, find $2^{2x}$
# Regular stuff
1. P0: Write in your own words end to end from cosine expansion to the Basel sum.
2. P1: Does the infinite series below converge or diverge? Why? If it converges, what does it converge to?
$$S = \frac{1}{1 \times 2 \times 3} + \frac{1}{2\times 3 \times 4}+\frac{1}{3\times 4 \times 5}+\dots$$
3) P2: The combinatorial term we encountered for the case of the 3-d random walk. Implement it in a numerically sound way in Python.
4) P0: People subscribe to and cancel to AI betting edge at discrete time intervals (beginning of every day). If there are $i$ subscribers already, the probability of a new subscriber is $\frac{.5^i}{1+.5^i}$. Each subscriber starts tossing a coin with probability $.1$ of heads every day after they subscribe. The day they get a heads is the day they unsubscribe. Once we get to 20 subscribers, we stop accepting new ones. You charge 50 dollars a month. In the steady state, how much income will you be making a month? You will need a computer for this one.
5) P1: Write CLR versions of DFS and BFS in Python. Don't skimp on any of the properties.

2. The number 1 works. Can just look at it and see.
3. Couldn't figure this one out



**Regular Stuff**

1. ![[basel_cos.png]]

2. Yes it converges because it's always smaller than the sum of 1/numbers to the power of 3, which we know converges. For example 1/(1x2x3) is always smaller then 1/1^3, 1/(2x3x4) is always smaller than 1/2^3, etc.
3. Next week
4. Did it in simulation, need to do it in matrix form. Below is simulation code:
~~~Python
import numpy as np
i = 20
revenue = i*50

count = {}
total_rounds = 10000

for val in range(total_rounds):
	x = [np.random.choice(['stay subscribed','unsubscribe'],p=[.9,.1]) for val in range(i)]
	if i < 20:
		new_subscriber_probability = (.5**i)/(1+(.5**i))
		new_subscriber = np.random.choice([0,1],p=[1-new_subscriber_probability,new_subscriber_probability])
	else:
		new_subscriber = 0
	num_unsubscribe = len([val for val in x if val=='unsubscribe'])
	net = new_subscriber-num_unsubscribe
	i+=net 
	revenue = i*50
	if revenue in count:
		count[revenue]+=1
	else:
		count[revenue]=1

print([(val,count[val]/total_rounds) for val in count])

~~~Python DFS

global time
time = 0


class Node:
	def __init__(self, number,d_time=None,f_time=None, pi=None, color='White'):
		self.name = str(number)
		self.d_time = d_time
		self.f_time = f_time
		self.pi = pi 
		self.color = color

	def __repr__(self):
		return self.name


nodes = [Node(0),Node(1),Node(2),Node(3),Node(4),Node(5),Node(6),Node(7),Node(8)]


graph = {nodes[5]:[nodes[1],nodes[6]],nodes[1]:[nodes[0],nodes[2]],nodes[2]:[nodes[3]],nodes[3]:[nodes[4]],
		nodes[6]:[nodes[7]],nodes[7]:[nodes[8]],nodes[4]:[],nodes[8]:[],nodes[0]:[]}



def dfs(graph,vertex):
	global time

	time+=1
	vertex.d_time = time
	vertex.color = 'Gray'


	for val in graph[vertex]:
		if val.color=='White':
			val.pi = vertex.name
			dfs(graph,val)
	time+=1
	vertex.f_time = time
	vertex.color='Black'
	print(vertex)



for val in nodes:
	if val.color=='White':
		dfs(graph,val)

~~~Python BFS
import numpy as np
from collections import deque

class Node:
	def __init__(self, number, d = np.inf, pi=None, color='White'):
		self.number = number
		self.name = str(number)
		self.d = d
		self.pi = pi 
		self.color = color

	def __repr__(self):
		return self.name


nodes = [Node(0),Node(1),Node(2),Node(3),Node(4),Node(5),Node(6),Node(7),Node(8)]

		nodes[6]:[nodes[7]],nodes[7]:[nodes[8]],nodes[4]:[],nodes[8]:[],nodes[0]:[]}

print(graph[nodes[5]])

# source = 5

def bfs(graph,source):
	source.color = 'Gray'
	source.d = 0

	queue = deque()
	queue.append(source)

	while queue:
		q = queue.popleft()
		for v in graph[q]:
			if v.color=='White':
				v.color='Gray'
				v.d = q.d + 1
				v.pi = q
				queue.append(v)
		q.color='Black'

bfs(graph,source)
