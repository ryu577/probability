# Algebra exercises
1. Use the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_root_theorem to find all other roots (we know they are all rational) of $x^3 - 7x + 6$. Also, understand the proof of the theorem. Write it down in your own words.
2. If $16^x + 256^{x - 1} = 10$, find $2^{2x}$. Exponents multiply.

# Regular
1) P0: Find the bug in your code for combinatorial term arising in 3-d random walk. Use as reference: https://github.com/ryu577/daily/blob/main/2311/231123.py.
2) P0: People subscribe to and cancel to AI betting edge at discrete time intervals (beginning of every day). If there are $i$ subscribers already, the probability of a new subscriber is $\frac{.5^i}{1+.5^i}$. Each subscriber starts tossing a coin with probability $.1$ of heads every day after they subscribe. The day they get a heads is the day they unsubscribe. Once we get to 20 subscribers, we stop accepting new ones. You charge 50 dollars a month. In the steady state, how much income will you be making a month? You will need a computer for this one.
3) P1: Read up to parenthesis theorem of CLR book, depth first search.
4) P0: Make a list of the different species of Markov chains we encountered in chapter 4. Describe what you understand of each of them.
5) P2: Read the blog (about how Cauchy makes the law of large numbers fail): https://medium.com/@rohitpandey576/cauchy-distribution-has-no-mean-from-huygens-principle-optics-38a588eb2e7b. Make notes about it and ask questions.
