# Algebra exercises
1. Use the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_root_theorem to find all other roots (we know they are all rational) of $x^3 - 7x + 6$. Also, understand the proof of the theorem. Write it down in your own words.
2. If $16^x + 256^{x - 1} = 10$, find $2^{2x}$. Exponents multiply.

1) P0: Find the bug in your code for combinatorial term arising in 3-d random walk. Use as reference: https://github.com/ryu577/daily/blob/main/2311/231123.py.
2) P0: People subscribe to and cancel to AI betting edge at discrete time intervals (beginning of every day). If there are $i$ subscribers already, the probability of a new subscriber is $\frac{.5^i}{1+.5^i}$. Each subscriber starts tossing a coin with probability $.1$ of heads every day after they subscribe. The day they get a heads is the day they unsubscribe. Once we get to 20 subscribers, we stop accepting new ones. You charge 50 dollars a month. In the steady state, how much income will you be making a month? You will need a computer for this one.
3) P1: Read up to parenthesis theorem of CLR book, depth first search.
4) P0: Make a list of the different species of Markov chains we encountered in chapter 4. Describe what you understand of each of them.
5) P2: Read the blog (about how Cauchy makes the law of large numbers fail): https://medium.com/@rohitpandey576/cauchy-distribution-has-no-mean-from-huygens-principle-optics-38a588eb2e7b. Make notes about it and ask questions.


# Algebra 
1. Big picture is that all roots of a polynomial are factors of the last coefficient divided by factors of the first coefficient. In more detail we can say all the roots X = p/q for some p and q. Now we dig into the proof and my understanding of it:
	1. First part is this Euclid's lemma. All it says is that if there's a number A that divides the product B x C, and A and B have no factors in common (like 3 and 7), then A must divide B. For example if A is 3, B is 7 and C is 15, 3 doesn't have any factors in common with 7, so it must divide 15 because it divides their product.
	2. Next we assume that X = p/q where p and q have no common factors is a solution of the standard polynomial representation and plug it in:

       3.  Then we multiply the whole thing by common factor of q^n to cancel out the denominator
       ![[rational_root_formula_2.jpeg]]
	       
	4. Then, if we move the A0 term over to the other side, we're left with terms that have common factor of P, so we factor out the P and get P multiplied by the rest is equal to A0q^n
	![[rational_root_formula_3.jpeg]]
	5. Sinice we know p can't divide by q, it must divide a0. The same argument holds for q dividing An if instead of taking A0 to the other side and factoring p, we take An to the other side and factor q.

3. Done
4. Different species of Markov Chains:
	1. Irreducible - all states can communicate with each other, only one class
	2. Finite state markov chain - finite number of states, gamblers ruin with walking away at 0 or fixed upper bound
	3. Infinite state markov chain - infinite number of states, random walk
	4. recurrent markov chain - all states will be visited an infinite number of times in expectation as n goes to infinity
	5. transient markov chain - some states will never be visited again in expectation as n goes to infinity
	6. positive recurrent markov chain
	7. aperiodic markov chain - each state can be visited in any number of steps, period of 1
	8. periodic markov chain - markov chain with period > 1
	9. ergodic markov chain
	10.
