# Algebra exercises
1. Use the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_root_theorem to find all other roots (we know they are all rational) of $x^3 - 7x + 6$. Also, understand the proof of the theorem. Write it down in your own words.
2. If $16^x + 256^{x - 1} = 10$, find $2^{2x}$. Exponents multiply.
3. Solve for x the equation $\log_9 (x^3) = \log_2(8)$

1. P1: what does it converge to? Derive on your own two ways (telescoping sums).
$$S = \frac{1}{1 \times 2 \times 3} + \frac{1}{2\times 3 \times 4}+\frac{1}{3\times 4 \times 5}+\dots$$
2) P1: The combinatorial term we encountered for the case of the 3-d random walk. Implement it in a numerically sound way in Python.
3) P0: People subscribe to and cancel to AI betting edge at discrete time intervals (beginning of every day). If there are $i$ subscribers already, the probability of a new subscriber is $\frac{.5^i}{1+.5^i}$. Each subscriber starts tossing a coin with probability $.1$ of heads every day after they subscribe. The day they get a heads is the day they unsubscribe. Once we get to 20 subscribers, we stop accepting new ones. You charge 50 dollars a month. In the steady state, how much income will you be making a month? You will need a computer for this one.
4) P1: Read section on breadth first trees, CLR.
5) P1: Read example 4.24 of Ross book.
6) P1: Watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA4JkHKZM50 and make notes.
7) P0: Make a list of the different species of Markov chains we encountered in chapter 4. Describe what you understand of each of them.

# Challenges
1) $S_j = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{i.(i+1)\dots (i+j-1)}$
2) Infinite version of Markov chain for subscribers. No limit on 20 subscribers.

2. Difficulty getting this one, need some help
~~~Python 
def return_value_stable(i,j,n):
	if i+j>n:
		return 'Cannot compute'

	print(i,j,n)

	product = 1

	numerator = [val for val in range(1,(2*n)+1)]
	denominator_i = [val for val in range(1,i+1)]
	denominator_i.reverse()
	denominator_j = [val for val in range(1,j+1)]
	denominator_j.reverse()

	print(denominator_i)
	print(denominator_j)

	pointer_numerator = 0
	pointer_i = 0
	pointer_j = 0
	print('length denominator i',len(denominator_i))
	print('length denominator j',len(denominator_j))
	print('length numerator',len(numerator))

	while pointer_i<len(denominator_i) and pointer_j<len(denominator_j):
		print(pointer_i,pointer_j,pointer_numerator)
		if denominator_i[pointer_i] < denominator_j[pointer_j]:
			product*= (numerator[pointer_numerator]/denominator_i[pointer_i])
			pointer_i+=1
		else:
			product*= (numerator[pointer_numerator]/denominator_j[pointer_j])
			pointer_j+=1
		pointer_numerator+=1
	print(pointer_i,pointer_j,pointer_numerator)
	return product

5. Video notes: 
	1. I dont get when he describes the height of the curve as "probability per unit in the x direction". How does that reconcile with the probability of any one specific point being zero? Am a bit confused on what the height represents in a PDF
