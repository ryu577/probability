1) P0: Motivate the number $e$ from compound interest. Why should it be the sum of inverse factorials of natural numbers?
2) P1: Read the blog: https://medium.com/@rohitpandey576/cauchy-distribution-has-no-mean-from-huygens-principle-optics-38a588eb2e7b. Make notes about it and ask questions.
3) P0: Read section 4.4 of Ross up until example 4.24.
4) P1: Get the sample mean of 10,000 Cauchy random numbers. Repeat this 20 times and plot the histogram. Do the same for 10,000 random variables from the exponential distribution.
5) P0: Do the same thing Euler did to prove the Basel problem, but for cosine instead of sin. What do you get?
6) P1: Read section 22.3 (DFS) of CLR book, upto corollary 22.8.
