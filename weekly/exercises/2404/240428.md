1. P0: Code the mean time to sequence for some simple Markov chains and verify Ross's formula with simulation. 
	1. As a first step, imagine the sequence is just a single state.
2. P0: Re-read your writing of the story behind AUROC ([240317]). You should be able to recite the story and re-create the interpretation of the metric from scratch.
3. P0: Matrix chain multiplication: implement code that will give me the optimal way to multiply.

4. P1: In the generate all permutations code, you're going to be handing the permutations to my program one at a time. My program will run a test on them and tell you when some condition is satisfied. When my program returns True, your code should stop and return that permutation. How would you implement this?
