There are n choose m corners in the simplex method. Ross is talking about this in a chapter on markov chains because the process of which the simplex algorithm goes from one of the corners of the simplex to the optimal solution can be modeled as a markov chain. He's also trying to show that while there are n choose m corners, the algorithm converges to the optimal solution much faster than expected. 

Questions - why are there n choose m extreme points?
 You have m equations and you're creating n-m more equations with the inequalities. The m equations are non optional. and we n inequalities, all X's are greater or equal to 0. And we have to choose n-m of them to be equalities. so there are n choose n-m ways of doing that, which is equal to n choose m. 

Step 1 - make a simplex with the constraints. Set of all points that satisfy the constraints

Step 2 - look at objective function. it's linear - because of the forward/backward argument it has to be at a vertex 

Step 3 - run simplex to find optimal vertex
