- Simulate generating two uniform random numbers and seeing if the three segments they create (between 0 and 1) can form a triangle. What probability do you get?
- Prove that the mid element of $n$ numbers when $n$ is odd will always be $(n+1)/2$.
- Complexity analysis for leetcode array jump problem. Time and space.
- Prove the white path theorem from CLRS.
- Gamblers ruin problem.. average time spent in state $2$ for $i=3$ and $n=6$. solve using mean time spent in transient states approach.

```Python
import random
import numpy as np

array = []


for val in range(100000):
	number1 = random.uniform(0, 1)
	number2 = random.uniform(0, 1)


	if number1 < number2:
		length1 = number1
		length2 = number2-number1
		length3 = 1 - number2 
	else:
		length1 = number2
		length2 = number1 - number2 
		length3 = 1 - number1 


	if length1+length2 < length3 or length2+length3 < length1 or length1+length3 < length2:
		array.append(0)
	else:
		array.append(1)
print(np.mean(array))
