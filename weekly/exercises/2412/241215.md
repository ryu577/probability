Background: $L_1$ and $L_2$ are two independent uniform random numbers between $0$ and $1$. They cut the unit line into three segments. 
The three segments are $x$, $y$ and $z$.

 1. Prove that the mid element of integers from $1$ to $n$ where $n$ is odd will always be $(n+1)/2$. Hint: express $n=2k+1$ to ensure its odd.
 2. Prove geometrically that $P(y>0.5)=0.25$
 3. Prove geometrically that $P(x>0.5)$ and $P(z>0.5)$ are also $0.25$. What regions of the $L_1$, $L_2$ square do these probabilities represent?
 4. Exercise 10 of section 1.9 from Huang book. Hint: construct a unit test.
 5. Construct a process that returns two uniform random numbers but they have to be correlated. If we use this process to get $L_1$ and $L_2$, then how does the probability a triangle can be formed change?
