Background: $L_1$ and $L_2$ are two independent uniform random numbers. They cut the unit line into three segments of lengths $x$, $y$ and $z$.
1. Prove geometrically that $P(x>0.5)$ and $P(y>0.5)$ are 0.25. What regions in the $L_1$ - $L_2$ graph do they represent?
2. Read branching process section, upto example 4.32 Ross.
3. Complexity analysis for leetcode array jump problem. Time and space. Everything is worst case.
4. Problem 5 of section 1.9, Huang.
5. Find the old Beta regression model code we had worked on.
