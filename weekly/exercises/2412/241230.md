Background: $L_1$ and $L_2$ are two independent uniform random numbers. They cut the unit line into three pieces, $x$, $y$ and $z$.
1. Prove geometrically that $P(x > 0.5) = 0.25$ and $P(z>0.5) = 0.25$ in the $L_1$-$L_2$ graph.
2. Branching process. Read and be ready to answer questions about it.
3. Complexity analysis of leetcode jump game.
4. Blitzstein and Huang section 1.9 problem 11.
