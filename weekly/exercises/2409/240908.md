1.
```python
class Solution:

    def combinationSum4(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:

        dp = {}

  

        if min(nums)>target:

            return 0

        def traverse_down(current_target):

            if current_target==0:

                return 1

            elif current_target < 0:

                return 0

            if current_target in dp:

                return dp[current_target]

            ways = 0

            for val in nums:

                remaining = current_target - val

                ways += traverse_down(remaining)

            dp[current_target] = ways

            return dp[current_target]

        return traverse_down(target)

3. The law of total variance derivation is a clever use of conditional variance and algebraic manipulation. Below is the derivation from the book. I will explain it step by step.
![[law_of_total_variance.jpeg]]
What the image says is that the variance of X can be expressed as the expected value of the the variance of x given y, plus the variance of the expected value of X given Y. It's this clever thing where you flip flop the order of expected value and variance on X given Y and sum them together and you magically get the variance of X. But of course nothing is magic, so let's go through the proof.

First, he derives the first term E(Var(X|Y)). We know that the regular variance of X|Y is E[X^2|Y] - (E[X|Y])^2 as this just follows from the definition of variance which is E(X^2) - (E(X))^2

He takes the expected value of this conditional variance above and what happens is the first term by the law of iterated expectation just becomes E[X^2]. The second term we can't simplify, but it ends up cancelling out with the second part of the law.

The second part of the law is Var(E[X|Y]). Now again we know the formula for variance is  E(X^2) - (E(X))^2 so if we just treat E(X|Y) as "X", then we get his result above. And it simplifies to the formula we're used to for variance of X.
