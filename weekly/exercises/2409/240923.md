A tree edge is an edge that leads to a vertex that hasn't been visited yet. If the procedure is currently at a vertex u and discovers a new vertex v which hasn't been visited yet, the edge u->v is a tree edge.
A back edge connects a node to one of it's ancestors in a tree. This can be used to detect a cycle in a graph. If DFS is currently at vertex `u` and encounters an edge u->v where v is already visited and is an ancestor of u in the DFS tree, then u->v is a **back edge**.

A cross edge connects two vertices that are not directly related in the DFS tree.
    
A cross edge goes between two vertices that are in different DFS trees or subtrees, meaning the vertices are neither ancestors nor descendants of each other in the DFS tree.

If DFS is currently at vertex u and encounters an edge u ->v where v is already visited and is neither an ancestor nor a descendant of u, then u->v is a **cross edge**.


Pv = v. Somewhere on right hand side there is vMax. Right hand side, you are making a combination of v with rows of P that sum to less than 1. If you are making those combinations, you can never get something equal to vMax. Need to prove that.
