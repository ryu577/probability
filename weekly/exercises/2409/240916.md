3. The column rank of a matrix is the number of independent columns in that matrix. A full rank matrix is a matrix where all it's columns are independent. This relates to the null space of a matrix because the dimension of the null space + the column rank must equal the number of total columns in the matrix. So for a full rank matrix, the dimension of the null space is 0. For a 4x4 matrix with 2 independent columns, the dimension of the null space is 2. The determinant relates to this because when a matrix is full rank, the determinant of that matrix is non zero. If the matrix has some dependent columns, the determinant will be zero.

5. $S_i$ is 1 or -1 depending on whether the first transition out of i is to i+1 or i-1, respectively. $N_i$ is is number of additional transition it takes to reach state i+1 from when the chain first enters state i. $v_i$ is the variance of $N_i$
