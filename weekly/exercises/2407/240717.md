1. P0: What is the time and space complexity of the Simplex method in the number of variables $n$ and equations, $m$? Why?
2. P0: Can logistic regression be done online in the same way as linear regression? Why or why not?
3. P0: Read upto and including boolean satisfiability section from Ross.
4. P1: Read first chapter of geometric linear algebra book.


1.It's n choose m worst case, and for average case it becomes $m[1 + log(c âˆ’ 1)]$
Below is the end to end proof:

2. No it cannot, because the trick that's used in online linear regression used outer products, which only work with linear equations. Logistic regression has a sigmoid at the end of it so that all values are forced between zero and one, and this sigmoid function has an exponential in it, which obviously isn't linear.
